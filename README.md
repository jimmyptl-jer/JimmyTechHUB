To push code to a GitHub repository, you need to use Git commands. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)**:
   If you haven't initialized a Git repository in your project folder, you need to do this first. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project folder, then run:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Files to Staging Area**:
   Stage the files you want to commit by using the `git add` command. You can add specific files or use `.` to add all files in the current directory.

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**:
   Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message using the `git commit` command:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

4. **Link to GitHub Repository**:
   If you haven't linked your local repository to the GitHub repository, you need to add the remote URL. Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository>` with your repository name.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
   ```

5. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
   Finally, push your committed changes to GitHub using the `git push` command. Replace `<branch>` with the branch you want to push to (usually `main` or `master`):

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch>
   ```

6. **Enter Credentials**:
   If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password/token for authentication. To avoid entering credentials each time, consider using an SSH key or a personal access token.

Here's the entire sequence of commands:

```bash
# Run these commands once if the repository is not already initialized
git init

# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Link to your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin <branch>
```

For more advanced scenarios or if you're using different authentication methods (SSH keys, access tokens), the commands might vary slightly. Make sure to adapt the commands to your specific use case.

How you can create a new branch and push code to GitHub using Git commands:

1. **Create a New Branch**:
   To create a new branch and switch to it, use the following command. Replace `<new-branch-name>` with the name you want to give your new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
   ```

2. **Make Changes and Commit**:
   Make your changes to the code, stage them, and commit as usual:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

3. **Push New Branch to GitHub**:
   When you're ready to push the new branch to GitHub, use the following command. Replace `<new-branch-name>` with the name of your new branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin <new-branch-name>
   ```

   If the branch doesn't exist on the remote (GitHub) repository, this command will create the branch and push your changes to it.

So, here's the complete sequence of commands:

```bash
# Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

# Make changes, stage, and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Push the new branch to GitHub
git push origin <new-branch-name>
```

This will create a new branch, add your changes, commit them, and then push the new branch along with the changes to your GitHub repository.

Merging two repositories can be a bit complex, especially if they have divergent histories or if you want to preserve all historical data. Here's a general outline of how you might go about merging two repositories:

1. **Clone Both Repositories**:
   Clone both repositories to your local machine. You'll need the URLs of both repositories.

   ```bash
   # Clone first repository
   git clone <repository1_url> repo1

   # Clone second repository
   git clone <repository2_url> repo2
   ```

2. **Combine Repositories**:
   Navigate into the directory of one repository (e.g., `repo1`) and add the other repository as a remote.

   ```bash
   cd repo1
   git remote add repo2-remote ../repo2
   ```

3. **Fetch and Merge**:
   Fetch the commits from the remote repository and merge them into your current repository's branch (e.g., `main`).

   ```bash
   git fetch repo2-remote
   git merge repo2-remote/main
   ```

   Handle any conflicts that arise during the merge.

4. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   If there are conflicts, resolve them by editing the conflicted files, then commit the resolved changes.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Merged repository2 into repository1"
   ```

5. **Repeat for Other Branches**:
   If you have multiple branches in the second repository that you want to merge, repeat the fetch and merge steps for each branch.

6. **Preserve History (Optional)**:
   If you want to preserve the entire history of both repositories, consider using `git filter-repo` or other specialized tools to create a new repository that includes the complete history of both repositories. This can be complex and may require some expertise.

7. **Update Remote**:
   After merging and resolving conflicts, you can push the changes to the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

Remember that merging repositories can lead to complications, especially if the repositories have significant differences in their histories. It's important to carefully plan and back up your data before attempting such a merge. If you're not comfortable with these steps, consider seeking assistance from someone experienced in Git or version control.
