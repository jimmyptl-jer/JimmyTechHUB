## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

## Usage

Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## File Structure

- `index.js`: Main entry point of the application.
- `routes/main.js`: Express router for main routes.
- `controllers/main.js`: Controllers for handling login and dashboard functionality.
- `middleware/auth.js`: Authentication middleware for protecting routes.
- `middleware/not-found.js`: Middleware for handling 404 errors.
- `middleware/error-handler.js`: Middleware for handling custom errors.
- `public/`: Static files (e.g., stylesheets, images) served by the application.

## Environment Variables

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation and verification.

Certainly! Let's break down the purpose of each file in the provided file structure:

### 1. `index.js`

- **Main entry point of the application.**
  
  This file is the starting point for your Node.js application. It typically sets up the Express application, defines middleware, includes route handlers, and starts the server.

### 2. `routes/main.js`

- **Express router for main routes.**

  In this file, you define the routes of your application using Express's `Router` module. It contains the route definitions for the main functionality of your application. In your case, it includes routes for user login (`/login`) and the dashboard (`/dashboard`).

### 3. `controllers/main.js`

- **Controllers for handling login and dashboard functionality.**

  This file contains the controller functions that handle the business logic for your application. For example:
  
  - `login`: Handles user login by validating credentials, generating a JWT token, and sending a response.
  - `dashboard`: Handles the dashboard functionality, including authentication using a middleware (`auth.js`), and responding with data.

### 4. `middleware/auth.js`

- **Authentication middleware for protecting routes.**

  Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request, response, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. In this specific middleware (`auth.js`), it checks for a valid JWT token in the request header, verifies it, and attaches user information to the request object.

### 5. `middleware/not-found.js`

- **Middleware for handling 404 errors.**

  This middleware is executed when no route is matched. It sets the HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found) and sends a response indicating that the requested resource could not be found.

### 6. `middleware/error-handler.js`

- **Middleware for handling custom errors.**

  This middleware is responsible for catching and handling custom errors. It sets the HTTP status code based on the error and sends a formatted response with information about the error.

### 7. `public/`

- **Static files (e.g., stylesheets, images) served by the application.**

  This directory is typically used to store static assets that your application may serve, such as stylesheets, images, or client-side JavaScript files. These files can be accessed directly by clients without going through the server logic.

Understanding the purpose of each file in your file structure helps in organizing and maintaining your code. Each file has a specific role in the overall architecture of your application, promoting separation of concerns and modularity.
